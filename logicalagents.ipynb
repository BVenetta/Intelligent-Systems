    "If you do not provide your name and VUnetID we will not accept your submission. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning objectives\n",
    "At the end of this exercise you should be able to work with logical agents on the Schnapsen platform\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Be able to apply a SAT solver to check for satisfiability and entailment (bots)\n",
    "2. Apply a SAT solver for build an knowledge-based agent for playing Schnapsen. \n",
    "3. Build own variants of a knowledge-based agent for Schnapsen. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Preliminaries\n",
    "\n",
    "In this worksheet we'll use Propositional Logic and a specific version of a Propositional Logic solver (SMT solver) to build a fully knowledge based agent playing Schnapsen. The idea is to represent the strategies humans apply to play the game and to apply logical reasoning to identify good, bad, safe or risky moves, whatever you wish to model. \n",
    "This kind of reasoning---setting up logical statements and proving unsatisfiability. \n",
    "\n",
    "First things first, let's deal with dependencies for using the kb bot, namely numpy and scipy. They should be installed fairly easily via \"pip install numpy\", \"pip install scipy\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practicalities\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow this Notebook step-by-step. \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, you can do the exercises in any Programming Editor of your liking. But you do not have to. Feel free to simply write code in the Notebook. Please use your studentID+Assignment4.ipynb as the name of the Notebook.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: unlike the courses dedicated to programming we will not evaluate the style of the programs. But we will, however, test your programs on other data that we provide, and your program should give the correct output to the test-data as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "As was mentioned, the assignment is graded as pass/fail. To pass you need to have either a full working code or an explanation of what you tried and what didn't work for the tasks that you were unable to complete (you can use multi-line comments or a text cell).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Initialising \n",
    "\n",
    "First, let us make sure the necessary packages are installed, and imported. Run the following code:"
